## Paf le chien

A port of HTTP/AF for MirageOS. It handles TLS connection with:
- the new version of `conduit` (3.0.0)
- `ocaml-tls`
- `mirage-tcpip`

This library wants to provide an easy way to start an HTTP/AF
server with MirageOS. It provides a simple client too. The project,
even if it was used by me for my unikernels, is a bit experimental.
